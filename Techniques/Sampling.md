Sampling methods

In this section we will discuss the methods of obtaining samples. The main that we will be focusing on are Hair and Buccal, or Saliva, samples. These samples are used when we wish to compare samples that were collected at a crime scene with those that were provided by the suspect(s).  

Hair Samples.  
This type of sample is non-invasive, however there is some pain involved do people have a tendency to dislike this method.When we talk about hair samples, in terms of DNA, we are only interested in the Hair Follicle found at the end. In appearance it looks like a "bulb", see the image below, it is in here that the DNA information is contained. Typically when we wish to take hair samples we would need at least ten strands of hair, that have the follicle attached.

The next sample type is a Buccal or Oral swab. 
This type of sample is also non-invasive, just like the afore mentioned Hair follicle, however it is also much easier to obtain than the hair sample as only one swab sample is, generally, required. For this method a swab or cotton bud is inserted into the buccal cavity and is lightly rubbed against the check. This transfers some of the cells on the check to the swab which can then be removed through the extraction process.

The first thing that must be done is that we must, of course, get permission to take the sample.  
Sample Preparation  
Unfortunately we must first prepare the hair sample for the PCR amplification step. This is done by a process known as extraction. 
During extraction the DNA of the hair samples are removed and concentrated before the amplification. While this method concentrates the DNA it is still in too small a quantity for us to analysis with any degree of accuracy. The Extraction that we use is very simple and straightforward. There are many different suppliers of DNA extraction kits, however the vast majority all follow the same basic format.  

This format can be broken down into the reagents that are used and what they do.

* Lysis Buffer: the Lysis buffer is used to intially breakdown the cell wall and expose the DNA. It is very important in Hair sample analysis.  
* Cell Lysate: This lysate does a very similar job to the first one however it is primarily concerned with the breakdown of the nucleus membrane that contains the DNA.  
* Protein Denaturation: This process is very important as it prevents certain proteins from destroying genetic material. It is usually followed be a length of time in an ice block which forces all the bits of cell and denatured proteins out of solution.
*  Alchol Wash 1: This step uses a weak alcoholic wash to disolve the DNA into solution and change its polarity, this will become important in a moment, it also forces more of the proteins out of solution. This step is where we will encounter the first of the spin columns. This spin column is used to remove the bits of cell and large "bulky" proteins from the sample. This wash step is usually done twice.
*  Alcohol Wash 2: This step uses a stronger alcohol. The liquid that was collected after the spin step is then transferred to another container and mixed with alcohol wash 2. The second spin column is then used. The sample is added to the column and then "spun-down" on a centrifuge. this step is done twice. The purpose of this is to bind the DNA to the resin, by the polarity of the DNA, in the spin column and then the alcohol is used to wash out any impurities, i.e leftover proteins.
*  Desolvation: This step involves the final wash step. In this step the DNA that has been bound to the resin becomes unbound and is allowed to be collected in a container for amplification, this is of course done using a centrifuge again. The sample is then stored in a freezer at minus twenty before the PCR step is run.  

To note is that in the case of the Buccal swab an intial wash step is required to remove the cells from the swab to allow for the extraction, as outlined above, to begin.
