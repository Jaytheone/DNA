Sampling methods

In this section we will discuss the methods of obtaining samples. The main that we will be focusing on are Hair and Buccal, or Saliva, samples. These samples are used when we wish to compare samples that were collected at a crime scene with those that were provided by the suspect(s).  
Hair Samples.  
When we talk about hair samples, in terms of DNA, we are only interested in the Hair Follicle found at the end. In appearance it looks like a "bulb", see the image below, it is in here that the DNA information is contained. Typically when we wish to take hair samples we would need at least ten strands of hair, that have the follicle attached.

The first thing that must be done is that we must first, of course, get permission to take the sample.  
Sample Preparation  
Unfortunately we must first prepare the hair sample for the PCR amplification step. This is done by a process known as extraction. 
During extraction the DNA of the hair samples are removed and concentrated before the amplification. While this method concentrates the DNA it is still in too small a quantity for us to analysis with any degree of accuracy. The Extraction that we use is very simple and straightforward.
