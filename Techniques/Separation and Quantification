There are many different techniques that we can use in order to gather information pertaining to the DNA that we have previously
extracterd. The three that we will be focusing on at this moment are the ones that have the most value to us forensic scientist today. These
are:  

* Capillary Electrophoresis
* Gel Electrophoresis
* PCR Quantification
  
Firstly, we lookat the differnet separation techniques, Capillary and Gel Electrophoresis. They both operate using similar principles, they both
cause separation based on charge. However the differene occurs when we consider the mediums through which both processes are carried out.  

In the case of the Gel Electrophoresis, it uses a gel membrane, of varying concentration, to separate out the DNA. This is achieved by changing
the mass of the gel that was used in making the gel plate as it is called. Typically we use "Agarose" for this purpose. There are other substances
that can be used either but for the purpose of this we will stick with what we know. The strength of the gel will determine how long the 
gel must be let run for and also what the degree of separation will be like for the bands, see the picture below.
