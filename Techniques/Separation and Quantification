There are many different techniques that we can use in order to gather information pertaining to the DNA that we have previously
extracterd. The three that we will be focusing on at this moment are the ones that have the most value to us forensic scientist today. These
are:  

* Capillary Electrophoresis
* Gel Electrophoresis
* PCR Quantification
  
Firstly, we lookat the differnet separation techniques, Capillary and Gel Electrophoresis. They both operate using similar principles, they both
cause separation based on charge.
