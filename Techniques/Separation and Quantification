There are many different techniques that we can use in oreder to gather more information regarding the DNA that we have previously extracted. The three ways that we will focus on are as follows:  

 * Gel Electrophoresis
 * Capillary Electrophoresis
 * PCR Quantification  
 
 Looking at Gel Electrophoresis first we know that it separates the DNA strands based on there charge and their size. This is possible due to the variations in the strength of the gel that is made and how long the gel is allowed to run for. The gel that we use the most often is called "agarose", there are other gels that can be used instead. We can alter the strength of the gel that we use by changing the amount of agarose that we use in making the gel. The strength of the gel determines how long the gel will need to reun before we can get an appropriate amount of separation, called the degree of separation. we use a simple formula to determine the stength of the gel that we will use. Under normal conditions we will need a gel of 50cm^3 typically we make enough gel for a 100cm^3 run, this is incase that something goes wrong and we can run the gel again without having to remake it. Typically we use a gel of around 1.5% w/v (1.5g/100cm^3). depending on how much pure genomic DNA we must separate this number might be increase or decreased, increased for less DNA AND decreased for more.
