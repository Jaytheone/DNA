# Techniques - DNA Extraction

DNA extraction can be performed from a large variety of samples of biological matter.  
For samples taken from the person, usually hair root tips or mouth swabs are used, as opposed to blood samples, as blood samples are both invasive and unnecessary. Under {LAW}, mouth swabs and hair root tips are the sample methods recommended.  
For samples not taken from the person, hair with intact root-tips, blood, flesh, and other bodily substances can all be sources of DNA which may be extracted. The methodologies we use for extracting DNA from a number of materials are outlined below.
