# Techniques - DNA Extraction

DNA extraction can be performed from a large variety of samples of biological matter.  
For samples taken from the person, usually hair root tips or mouth swabs are used, as opposed to blood samples, as blood samples are both invasive and unnecessary. Under {LAW}, mouth swabs and hair root tips are the sample methods recommended.  
For samples not taken from the person, hair with intact root-tips, blood, flesh, and other bodily substances can all be sources of DNA which may be extracted. The methodologies we use for extracting DNA from a number of materials are outlined below.  

## DNA Extraction from Mouth Swabs
### these could all be broken out into sub-articles/pages if they get too long
Buccal (cheek tissue, or "mouth") swabs are one of the least invasive methods of obtaining DNA samples from an individual, and are one of the preferred methods for obtaining reference standards. DNA extraction from buccal swabs is a well standardized procedure, which involves the following (somewhat generalized) steps.  
1. Swab is removed from the sealed sampling tube. This tube will have identifying information about it which must be noted down and logged so that the sample can be traced.  
2. "Tip" of the swab is removed via sterilized scissors from the rest of the swab and placed into a sterile tube containing DNA extraction solution.
3. The swab-tip held within the DNA extraction solution is vortex-mixed and incubated at $TEMP for $TIME.
4. The DNA solution is then centrifuged and filtered $PROTOCOL_HERE to remove cellulaer debris
