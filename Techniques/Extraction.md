# Techniques - DNA Extraction

DNA extraction can be performed from a large variety of samples of biological matter.  
For samples taken from the person, usually hair root tips or mouth swabs are used, as opposed to blood samples, as blood samples are both invasive and unnecessary. Under {LAW}, mouth swabs and hair root tips are the sample methods recommended.  
For samples not taken from the person, hair with intact root-tips, blood, flesh, and other bodily substances can all be sources of DNA which may be extracted. The methodologies we use for extracting DNA from a number of materials are outlined below.  

## DNA Extraction from Mouth Swabs
### these could all be broken out into sub-articles/pages if they get too long

### these could all be broken out into sub-articles/pages if they get too long

## DNA Extraction from Blood (liquid)
### these could all be broken out into sub-articles/pages if they get too long

## DNA Extraction from Blood (dried)
