# Techniques - Polymerase Chain Reaction

In Forensic DNA analysis there are only thirteen loci of the human genome that we need to concern ourselves with.  
This is due to the fact that these loci are used for identification of an individual.  

Here we will be looking at the methods and the processes that will be needed for the PCR to operate, the loci that are most commonly looked at including the STR's and VNTR's and what Electrophoresis is and what it is used for in regards to the analysis that are commonly run on DNA.  
PCR is used mostly for the amplification of genetic material and for the initial "cutting" of the genetic material before analysis. PCR  can be split into three different subsections, Intial Denaturation, Annealing, Elongation.   
The first step the Intiail Denaturation is to breakdown any unwanted protiens that might destroy the genetic meterial if left in the sample mix. That is the only perpose of this step.  
Next we have the Annealing step. This step is actually a three step process that comprises of a denaturation step, an annealing step and an extension step. These three steps are typically repeated at a rate of around three hundred seconds. this varies between samples and the degree of denaturation that the samples have undergone before we could analyse them, i.e Dried blood and liquid blood.  
The Final Elongation is the step at which all the genetic material reanneals with the opposing strnds for the final time and is rewound back into the double helix form. This can be due to the limiting fact of the amount of reagents that are still available in the mix matrix for the PCR.  

The reagents involved are as follows and they are in their simpliest form as they do vary greatly depending on the PCR machine thaqt you have access to and the typoe of genetic information that you are after.
* dNucleotides- these are the free nucleotide bases that are used in the making of the new DNA sequence.  
* Forward and Reverse Primers- these start at opposing ends of the DNA Sequence, the three prime and the five prime ends, they are then used to "flag" the areas to which the free nucleotide bases are needed to be added.  
* Buffer agent- the purpose of the buffere agent is to optimise the the pH conditions required for PCR
* Taq Polymerase- is a part of the annealing process that makes the bases join in the sequence.
* PCR grade water- is used to "bulk-up" the master mix volume, to allow for easier handling and to increase the number of samples that can be dealt with at anyone time.

The mechanism behind the elongation step is quite straightforward. The mechanism uses a primer, which a section of genetic code that can vary in lenght but is a match for a section of the DNA code that is to be amplified or cut, which then moves along the DNA strand from either the thre prime, 3', or the five prime,5', end. The difference between the three and five prime ends is simpley just the direction in which the primer moves, this typically from the 3' to the 5'.  

During any PCR analysis there are, at least, three enzymes that are required. They may vary depending on the species that are being analysed but they are all used. They are Topoisomerase, Helicase and Polymerase.  
Topoisomerase- This enzyme is important in that it is used to uncoil the DNA into the strands. More specificaly it " alters the supercoil form of the DNA molecule."  
Helicase- The purpose behind the helicase enzyme is that breaks the bonds that hold the DNA strands together, i.e it breaks the hydrogen bonds between the nucleotides. Essentially it turns the DNA helix into two single DNA strands.  
Polymerase- This enzyme is used to bind the new DNA strand to the old, using the free nucletodies that are found in the solution that we made for the amplification of the DNA, The dNusleotides.  
Restriction Enzymes- The purpose of the restriction enzymes is to "cut" the DNA at a specified point. A restriction enzyme is a length of genetic code that, when it finds a suitable match, wil cut the DNA chain at that point. There are diferent types of restriction enzymes but they can found using the link below.
