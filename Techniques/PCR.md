In Forensic DNA analysis there are only thirteen loci of the human genome that we need to concern ourselves with. This is due to the fact that these loci are used for identification of an idividual.  Here we will be loking at the methods and the processes that will be needed for the PCR to operate, the loci that are most commonly looked at including the STR's and VNTR's and what Electrophoresis is and what it is used for in regards to the analysis that are commonly run on DNA.  
PCR is used mostly for the amplification of genetic material and for the initial "cutting" of the genetic material before analysis. PCR can be split into three different subsections, Intial Denaturation, Annealing, Extension.
The first step
