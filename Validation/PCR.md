## Validation of PCR Methods  
In our lab, we use industry standard metholodologies of validating our PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) techniques and equipment to ensure it remains within standards and specifications, as part of our quality management process.

These validation methods include method validation, standard validation, testing against references to ensure reproducability of results, and internal validations. What each of these things mean, and how they are applied to PCR, are outlined below.

### Internal Validation  
Internal validation refers to validation procedures we carry out in-house within the laboratory to ensure the validity and applicability of all methods we use. This includes internal testing against reference standards, ensuring all equipment used is within-spec, and testing against both known samples and blank samples to ensure that methods used to not give rise to false positive or false negative results.  
With regard to PCR, this means that when a new method is introduced, it is tested against some known standards we retain in the lab to determine
