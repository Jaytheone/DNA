## Validation of PCR Methods  
In our lab, we use industry standard metholodologies of validating our PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) techniques and equipment to ensure it remains within standards and specifications, as part of our quality management process.

These validation methods include method validation, standard validation, testing against references to ensure reproducability of results, and internal validations. What each of these things mean, and how they are applied to PCR, are outlined below.

### Internal Validation  
Internal validation refers to validation procedures we carry out in-house within the laboratory to ensure the validity and applicability of all methods we use. This includes internal testing against reference standards, ensuring all equipment used is within-spec, and testing against both known samples and blank samples to ensure that methods used to not give rise to false positive or false negative results.  
With regard to PCR, this means that when a new method is introduced, it is tested against some known standards we retain in the lab to determine its reproducability and accuracy. Furthermore, techniques and methods are periodically re-checked as part of our quality management protocol to ensure that they do not fall outside of specifications.

### Standard Validation  
Standard validation refers to ensuring the validity of our standards as used in tests. This involves testing our standards against external references to ensure they do not fall outside specifications, and checking regularly to ensure that we are operating within the current best-practices and using standards which are both fit for purpose and quality assured. This not only applies to standards of DNA, but also to blank standards which are regularly checked to ensure that they are not contaminated or otherwise would give rise to inaccurate or non reproduceable results.
